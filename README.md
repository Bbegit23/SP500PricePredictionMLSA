**Predicting S&P 500 Stock Prices with Machine Learning Models and Sentiment Analysis**
The stock market's volatile and intricate nature, characterized by constant uncertainty and fluctuations, attracts a multitude of experts and investors who endeavor to forecast the future value of stocks and financial instruments.
Predicting stock market performance ranks among the most challenging tasks. The inherent internal volatility of the market adds complexity and difficulty to the forecasting process. Numerous variables come into play, encompassing physical and technical factors as well as rational and irrational behaviors. 
The convergence of these factors renders stock prices highly volatile and notoriously challenging to predict with a significant level of precision.

**This project aims to introduce an innovative approach utilizing machine learning models to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 index**.
To ensure an extensive array of correlated features with the closing price, I have anchored my methodology in historical stock data, technical indicators, and news headlines.
The dataset comprises daily data spanning seven years, encompassing a rich set of 28 features. 
**The project unfolds as follows:**  
   **1. Data Preparation:**
      * Data Collection and Sentiment Analysis:  
         * Utilizing web scraping techniques, I gathered news headlines.  
         * Employing sentiment analysis, I calculated an average sentiment score from the news headlines.  
         * Then I collect financial data with yfinance   
      * Data Integration:  
         * I combined the collected financial data and the computed sentiment scores into One Dataframe.  
   **2. Feature Engineering:**  
      * Technical Indicators:  
        I augmented the feature set by incorporating various technical indicators based on historical stock data.  
   **3. Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Correlations:**  
      * Rigorous data analysis and visualizations were conducted to unearth insights and patterns.  
      * Relationships between variables were scrutinized to identify meaningful correlations.  
   **4. Data Normalization and Handling Skewed Features:**  
      * Ensuring fair treatment, I normalized the data and addressed skewed features.  
   **5. Machine Learning Regression Models and Evaluation:**  
      * Employing advanced regression models, I predicted the Close price.  
      * The models were evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance.  
      
This project amalgamates diverse elements of data science and finance to create a predictive model for S&P 500 index closing prices.
